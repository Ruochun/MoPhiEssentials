# Algorithms

This directory contains low-level algorithms used in multi-physics simulations.

## Files to be Added from MoPhi

Please copy the following from the MoPhi repository's `algorithms` directory:
- Sorting algorithms
- Linear algebra operations
- Search algorithms
- Graph algorithms
- Mesh algorithms
- All related implementations

**Note**: Exclude any jitify-related algorithms as specified in the requirements.

## Current Placeholder Files

- `sorting.h`: Sorting algorithms (placeholder)
- `linear_algebra.h`: Linear algebra operations (placeholder)

These are placeholders and should be replaced with actual implementations from MoPhi.
