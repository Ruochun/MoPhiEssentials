# Core

This directory contains core data structures and functionality for MoPhiEssentials.

## Files to be Added from MoPhi

Please copy the following from the MoPhi repository's `core` directory:
- CPU-GPU vector implementations
- Mesh data structures
- Data management classes
- Memory allocation utilities
- All related header and source files

## Current Placeholder Files

- `vector.h`: CPU-GPU unified vector class (placeholder)
- `mesh.h`: Mesh data structure (placeholder)

These are placeholders and should be replaced with actual implementations from MoPhi.

## Key Concepts

- **CPU-GPU Vectors**: Unified interface for data that can reside on CPU or GPU
- **Mesh Format**: Standardized mesh representation for interoperability
- **Data Management**: Low-level infrastructure for efficient data handling
