# Common

This directory contains common type definitions, macros, and utilities shared across all MoPhiEssentials components.

## Files to be Added from MoPhi

Please copy the following from the MoPhi repository's `common` directory:
- All header files (*.h, *.hpp)
- Common type definitions
- Shared constants and enumerations
- Compiler-specific macros
- Version information

## Current Placeholder Files

- `types.h`: Basic type definitions
- `macros.h`: Compiler macros

These are placeholders and should be replaced with actual implementations from MoPhi.
